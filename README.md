# elk
This repository holds the files for a project that examined the relationship between Elk herds in Wyoming across different elevations.
## Project Description
This PDF is adapted from an ArcGIS Story Map product. The story map is, sadly, owned by ESRI and cannot be accessed without an account through the Montana State University Spatial Sciences Center. However, that does not mean that the content is any different, the transitions are just not integrated into the file. 
*This project was a final project in an advanced GIS course at Montana State University*
This project focused on investigating the relationship of Elk herds across Wyoming at different elevations by looking at the spatial distribution of known elk herds in Wyoming. The geoispatial analysis was completed within ArcGIS and ESRI products with open sourcedata from the Wyoming Fish and Wildlife Department.
